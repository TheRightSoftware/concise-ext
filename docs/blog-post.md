# How The Right Software Leverages AI for Rapid Product Development: A Chrome Extension Case Study

Ever wondered how modern software companies build products 10x faster without sacrificing quality? At The Right Software (TRS), we're constantly pushing the boundaries of AI-assisted development to deliver exceptional results for our clients. Today, I'm excited to share how we built Concise, our AI-powered Chrome extension that transforms lengthy web pages into digestible summaries â€“ and more importantly, what this means for your next software project.

## The Challenge: Building Smart Tools for the Modern Web

As a software development consultancy specializing in AI integration and custom software solutions, we noticed a common pain point: information overload. Our clients and their users were spending too much time trying to extract key information from lengthy web content. We saw an opportunity to showcase our expertise in AI implementation while solving a real problem.

## Our Solution: Concise - Where AI Meets Practical Utility

Concise isn't just another Chrome extension â€“ it's a testament to how we at TRS approach modern software development. Available now on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheRightSoftware/concise-ext), it showcases our ability to build practical, AI-powered tools that solve real-world problems.

### Key Features We Implemented:

- ðŸš€ **Instant Summaries**: Convert any webpage into 4-5 key bullet points
- ðŸŽ¯ **Smart Highlighting**: Automatically emphasizes important information
- ðŸ“‹ **Flexible Input**: Works with both webpage content and clipboard text
- ðŸ’¾ **Persistent Settings**: Your preferences stay synchronized across tabs
- âš¡ **Performance Optimized**: Built-in caching for lightning-fast repeated access
- ðŸ”’ **Secure**: Your API key and data remain private and encrypted

## Behind the Scenes: Our AI-First Development Approach

What sets us apart isn't just our use of AI â€“ it's how we leverage it throughout the entire development process. Let me walk you through how we built Concise using AI as our co-pilot.

### Phase 1: Rapid Prototyping with AI

We started by breaking down the project into clear, AI-friendly prompts. For example, our initial prompt was focused on core functionality:
```
Create a chrome extension that opens a menu and in that menu there is a button to take the major body text from a page, sends to a free AI engine to convert into concise 4-5 bullet points and then shows that results in text popup
```

This single prompt generated our initial extension structure, basic UI, and text extraction logic. From there, we iteratively refined the implementation through targeted prompts for specific features.

### Phase 2: Technical Implementation

We built Concise using a carefully selected stack:
- Modern HTML5/CSS3 for the interface
- Vanilla JavaScript for optimal performance
- Chrome Extensions API for seamless browser integration
- HuggingFace's bart-large-cnn model for reliable text processing

Each component was developed with both performance and user experience in mind, ensuring:
- Clean, maintainable code
- Robust error handling
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Secure data management

### Phase 3: User Experience Refinement

We focused on making Concise not just powerful, but intuitive to use:

1. **Quick Setup**
   - Simple API key configuration
   - Clear validation feedback
   - Persistent settings across sessions

2. **Smart Features**
   - Automatic highlighting of key information
   - One-click copy functionality
   - Clipboard mode for restricted content
   - Cache system for faster repeated access

3. **Error Prevention**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Clear user feedback
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Automatic recovery options

## Why Our Approach Matters for Your Project

The development of Concise demonstrates how we at TRS bring together:

- **Rapid Development**: What traditionally took months, we accomplished in weeks through strategic AI prompting
- **Quality Assurance**: Each feature was iteratively refined using AI-guided development
- **Cost Efficiency**: Faster development cycles mean better ROI for our clients
- **Future-Ready Solutions**: Built with scalability and maintenance in mind
